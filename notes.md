# Notes

use topic modeling on all podcasts.

Could create a bot that talks like Steve, (using #54 with https://github.com/abresler/markovifyR package. )

topic model or word2vec

theme detection based on transcripts

easy things like sentiment analyses

network analyses of words


Correlation between words, per person.


per episode  extract text, parse per sentence, color by host, 
sentiment higest. geom text that word?

nerdscore per episode. topicmodeling on entire corpus (will crash, so 1/4?)
use high socring words, or dividing words (Very much one topic very much not other topic.)  cclassify new episodes on nerdscore/ topics, 
worse word2vec to find likewise words.

Sentiment changes over time?

Search for title words in text, where is it relatively? (at end prob)

counting mentions of I and I'm
negative specific words such as: worry creepy, attacks, malware,
Zero Day, fiasco

maybe some of their banter over time? 
coffee cafeinated, 
sci-fi
errata
misceleany

'by the way' followed by something
