# Notes

use topic modeling on all podcasts.

Could create a bot that talks like Steve, (using #54 with https://github.com/abresler/markovifyR package. )

topic model or word2vec

theme detection based on transcripts

easy things like sentiment analyses

network analyses of words


Correlation between words, per person.


per episode  extract text, parse per sentence, color by host, 
sentiment higest. geom text that word?

nerdscore per episode. topicmodeling on entire corpus (will crash, so 1/4?)
huse high socring words, or dividing words (Very much one topic very much not other topic.)  cclassify new episodes on nerdscore/ topics, 
worse word2vec to find likewise words.

Is entiment changes over time?
